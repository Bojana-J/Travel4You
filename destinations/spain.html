			<h1> Holidays in Spain </h1>

			<p> Spain offers wide range of landscapes - from the Pyrenees to the sun-drenched beaches and magical desert-like regions.
				The country's spectacular landscape is blended with a multitude of architectural styles depending on where you are. Combining
				amazing regional culinary styles and a wealth of festivals, you have one of Europe's most popular destinations.</p>

			<p> Spain's 17 regions offer beautiful landscapes, exciting adventures and wonderful beaches - all combined with a laid back
				atmosphere and delicious food. Explore charming mountain villages with small white houses or visit Moorish fort and Romanesque
				churches. Or why not see some of the world's premier art collections?</p>

			<p> One must take the opportunity to take some of Spain's most sought after guided architectural tours. Barcelona is of course
				a favorite with its Gothic Quarter and Gaudi's stunning buildings. You just have to see the Sagrada Familia , the Basilica,
				which has not yet been completed, and whose exterior represents running stearin. In Granada , you can see the magnificent
				Moorish palace of the Alhambra and relax in Generalife's wonderful gardens. One should also take the opportunity to explore
				the Plaza de España in Seville . While in town, make sure you have a flamenco show in Triana , where this folk music
				and dance are said to originate.</p>

			<p> Cultural enthusiasts will love Spain's all museums and art galleries. Plan a weekend in Spain and visit the capital of
				the Basque Country and all its cultural highlights; Bilbao's pride is of course the Guggenheim Museum , with its famous
				titanium roof and the building's futuristic architecture. Admire Francisco de Goyas and other world famous Spanish artists'
				masterpieces at El Prado in Madrid. Also follow the development of Spain's perhaps most famous artist at the Picasso
				Museum in Barcelona.</p>

			<p> Also be sure to squeeze in a couple of outdoor adventures during your stay in Spain. Embark on a walk in the Picos de
				Europa National Park . Go skiing in the Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada , which is a short drive from Granada. You can also
				cycle along the country's 1,600 kilometers of unused railroad tracks, now called Via Verde .</p>

			<p> The further south you take the higher temperatures you can wait. Several resorts in southern Spain have an even stream
				of tourists all year round because of the pleasant climate. Explore all the wonderful beaches of the Costa Blanca or
				the Costa del Sol , although it's just a longer weekend trip to Spain. Although Nudists are welcome on Spanish beaches,
				many of them choose to vacation at Vera Playa , the country's first nudist hotel.</p>

			<p> If you like extreme water sports, head to Tarifa on the Atlantic coast. The strong winds are perfect for windsurfing and
				kite surfing all year round. Tarifa is also Spain's southernmost resort, so it's close to North Africa's best destinations.
				For example, jump on a 35-minute ferry to Tangier, Morocco.</p>

			<p> Spaniards have a plethora of festivals and other exciting events to offer, so be sure to take your trip with one of the
				country's annual festivities: see how the city of Seville is dramatically transformed during Semana Santa with religious
				processions just before Easter easter; choose a city along the coast to see how the city's Moorish and Christian heritage
				is celebrated during the festival in June; or party during Barcelona's biggest street fair, La Mercè, in September.</p>

						<h4 class="card-title">History</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Iberia (Spain) enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians, Basques and Celts. Early on its
							coastal areas were settled by Phoenicians who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities Cadiz and Malaga. Phoenician
							influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the Carthaginian Empire, becoming a major
							theater of the Punic Wars against the expanding Roman Empire. After an arduous conquest, the peninsula came fully
							under Roman Rule. During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later, much of it was conquered by
							Moorish invaders from North Africa. </p>

						<p class="hidden2">Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos,
							triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior
							to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government,
							which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy
							was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing
							a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalized
							world with economic and ecological challenges.</p>

						<h4 class="card-title">Geography</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Spain is Europe's fourth largest country. Mount Teide (Tenerife) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third
							largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a transcontinental country. On the west, Spain is bordered by
							Portugal; on the south, it is bordered by Gibraltar (a British overseas territory) and Morocco, through its exclaves
							in North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla, and the peninsula of Vélez de la Gomera). On the northeast, along the Pyrenees
							mountain range, it is bordered by France and the Principality of Andorra. Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave
							town called Llívia is surrounded by France.</p>

						<p class="hidden2">Spain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and a number
							of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar, known as plazas de soberanía ("places
							of sovereignty", or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the Chafarinas Islands and Alhucemas. The peninsula
							of Vélez de la Gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberanía. The isle of Alborán, located in the Mediterranean
							between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almería, Andalusia.
							The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa is a Spanish-French condominium.</p>

						<h4 class="card-title">Culture</h4>
						<p class="card-text"> Culturally, Spain is a Western country. Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making
							Spain one of the major Latin countries of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism,
							which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine,
							and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate
							and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing
							the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.</p>

						<p class="hidden2">It should be noted that after Italy (49) and China (45), Spain is the third country in the world with the most World
							Heritage Sites. At the present time it has 44 recognised sites, including the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees,
							which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the Côa Valley and Siega Verde, which is shared with
							Portugal (the Portuguese part being in the Côa Valley, Guarda), and the Heritage of Mercury, shared with Slovenia.[201]
							In addition, Spain has also 14 Intangible cultural heritage, or "Human treasures", Spain ranks first in Europe according
							to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List, tied with Croatia.</p>
