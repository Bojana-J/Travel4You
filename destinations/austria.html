						<h4 class="card-title">History</h4>
						<p class="card-text"> Settled in ancient times,[15] the Central European land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various
							Celtic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of Noricum was later claimed by the Roman Empire and made a province. Present-day
							Petronell-Carnuntum in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the
							Upper Pannonia province. Carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years. </p>

						<p class="hidden2">After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by Bavarians, Slavs, and Avars.[24] Charlemagne, King of the
							Franks, conquered the area in AD 788, encouraged colonization, and introduced Christianity.[24] As part of Eastern
							Francia, the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of Babenberg. The area was known as
							the marchia Orientalis and was given to Leopold of Babenberg in 976.[25]</p>

						<h4 class="card-title">Geography</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the Alps.[92] The Central Eastern Alps, Northern Limestone
							Alps and Southern Limestone Alps are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (84,000 km2 or 32,433 sq
							mi), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640 ft).
							The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.</p>

						<p class="hidden2">Austria lies between latitudes 46¬∞ and 49¬∞ N, and longitudes 9¬∞ and 18¬∞ E. It can be divided into five areas, the biggest
							being the Eastern Alps, which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the
							Alps and the Carpathians account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery
							of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower
							than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian granite plateau, it is located in the central area
							of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the Vienna basin comprises the remaining
							4%.

						<h4 class="card-title">Culture</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Austria was the birthplace of many famous composers such as Joseph Haydn, Michael Haydn, Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert,
							Anton Bruckner, Johann Strauss, Sr. and Johann Strauss, Jr. as well as members of the Second Viennese School such
							as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, then an independent
							Church Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was
							spent in Vienna.</p>

						<p class="hidden2">Vienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to
							the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the
							Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music. Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural
							centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the lute. Ludwig van Beethoven spent
							the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current national anthem, attributed to Mozart, was chosen after World
							War II to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.</p>
